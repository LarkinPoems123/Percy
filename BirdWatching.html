<h2>What is BirdWatching?</h2>
    
    <p>Birdwatching is a recreational activity that means going outside and
    observing the birds. We been doing this since the era of Queen Victoria.
    The people go to areas populated by birds and observing, taking notes or photographing.
    The people who do this is called birders and the average age is 40s to 50s but, that necessary
    doesn't mean everybody can do watching at 40s or 50s and stops. Everyone can do it!

    <p>To do birding, choose a location. It could be a park, your garden or a natural reserve! Then, observe, listening to calls and pay attention to the movement with your eyes or binoculars. When you see one, open your field guide or bird identification app, notice the size, colours, shape and behaviours. Use your camera or your smartphone to take photos.
